    "about": "My name is Jesus Jimenez, and I am a Software developer and freelancer based in Venezuela. I was born on September 22, 1998 and I am currently pursuing my Computer Engineering degree at the \"Universidad Nacional Experimental del Tachira (UNET)\" in San Cristobal, Venezuela. In February 2023, I will be starting my Master's degree in Big Data at the IMF Academy in Madrid, Spain.\n\nI have a passion for software engineering, and all-things programming. At the age of 9 I hosted my own Habbo Hotel Retro server on a blog, that was my very first experience with programming. Since then I'm a geek.\n\nI am also an avid fan of Progressive Rock/Metal music, my favorite bands include Opeth, Soen, Karnivool, Tool, and Leprous. I'm not a game but I do spent more time than what I would like in video games like League of Legends, Dota 2, and Magic The Gathering. ",

He sticks with tasks until completion, is pleasant to work with, and has had the ability to learn every new technology I have thrown at him. Highly recommended.\n\nHe built two mobile apps from scratch for my company, helped me handle customer support, and fixed bugs on my web application. He asks pertinent questions when he needs to, and has willingly and enthusiastically learned how my particular system works. I communicate with him over Slack, which has worked really well, as he is responsive.\n\nI don't offer much in terms of guidance or direction, so his ability to be a self-starter and figure things out on his own has been fantastic.",
